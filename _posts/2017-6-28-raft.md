- 本文目的:读 寻找一种易于理解的一致性算法的论文，记录核心点。

##### Introduction

- Strong leader: Raft uses a stronger form of leadership
than other consensus algorithms. For example,
log entries only flow from the leader to other servers.
This simplifies the management of the replicated log
and makes Raft easier to understand
- Leader election: Raft uses randomized timers to
elect leaders. This adds only a small amount of
mechanism to the heartbeats already required for any
consensus algorithm, while resolving conflicts simply
and rapidly.
- Membership changes: Raft’s mechanism for
changing the set of servers in the cluster uses a new
joint consensus approach where the majorities of
two different configurations overlap during transitions.
This allows the cluster to continue operating
normally during configuration changes.

##### Raft 算法

- Raft通过选举一个高贵的领导人，然后给予他全部的管理复制日志的责任来实现一致性。领导人从客户端接收日志条目，把日志条目复制到其他服务器上，并且当保证安全性的时候告诉其他的服务器应用日志条目到他们的状态机中。拥有一个领导人大大简化了对复制日志的管理。例如，领导人可以决定新的日志条目需要放在日志中的什么位置而不需要和其他服务器商议，并且数据都从领导人流向其他服务器。一个领导人可以宕机，可以和其他服务器失去连接，这时一个新的领导人会被选举出来。
- 通过领导人的方式，Raft 将一致性问题分解成了三个相对独立的子问题
  1. 领导选举：一个新的领导人需要被选举出来，当现存的领导人宕机的时候
  2. 日志复制：领导人必须从客户端接收日志然后复制到集群中的其他节点，并且强制要求其他节点的日志保持和自己相同。
  3. 安全性：如果有任何的服务器节点已经应用了一个确定的日志条目到它的状态机中，那么其他服务器节点不能在同一个日志索引位置应用一个不同的指令。
- 每一台服务有三种状态，领导者，跟随者，候选人

###### 核心数据结构

- state

state|Persistent state on all servers(Updated on stable storage before responding to RPCs)|
:---|:------------------|
currentTerm|latest term server has seen (initialized to 0  on first boot, increases monotonically)|
votedFor| candidateId that received vote in current term (or null if none)|
log[]| log entries; each entry contains command for state machine, and term when entry  was received by leader (first index is 1)|

state| Volatile state on all servers|
:----|:---------|
commitIndex| index of highest log entry known to be committed (initialized to 0, increases  monotonically)|
lastApplied| index of highest log entry applied to state  machine (initialized to 0, increases  monotonically)|

state| Volatile state on leaders(Reinitialized after election)|
:----|:-----|
nextIndex[]|for each server, index of the next log entry to send to that server (initialized to leader last log index + 1)
matchIndex[]| for each server, index of highest log entry known to be replicated on server
(initialized to 0, increases monotonically)|

- AppendEntries RPC.
- Invoked by leader to replicate log entries; also used as heartbeat.

Arguments | Explain|
:---------|:------|
term| leader’s term  leaderId so follower can redirect clients|
prevLogIndex| index of log entry immediately preceding new ones|
prevLogTerm| term of prevLogIndex entry|
entries[]| log entries to store (empty for heartbeat; may send more than one for efficiency)|
leaderCommit| leader’s commitIndex|

Results| Explain|
:------|:------|
term| currentTerm, for leader to update itself|
success| true if follower contained entry matching prevLogIndex  and prevLogTerm|

- Receiver implementation:
1. Reply false if term < currentTerm
2. Reply false if log doesn’t contain an entry at prevLogIndex  whose term matches prevLogTerm
3. If an existing entry conflicts with a new one (same index  but different terms),
delete the existing entry and all that  follow it
4. Append any new entries not already in the log
5. If leaderCommit > commitIndex, set commitIndex = min(leaderCommit, index of last new entry)

- RequestVote RPC  Invoked by candidates to gather votes.

Arguments| Explain|
:--------|:-------|
term| candidate’s term|
candidateId| candidate requesting vote|
lastLogIndex| index of candidate’s last log entry|
lastLogTerm| term of candidate’s last log entry |

Results| Explain|
term| currentTerm, for candidate to update itself|
voteGranted| true means candidate received vote|

- Receiver implementation:
1. Reply false if term < currentTerm
2. If votedFor is null or candidateId, and candidate’s log is at  least as up-to-date as receiver’s log, grant vote

- Rules for Servers

###### All Servers:
  - If commitIndex > lastApplied: increment lastApplied, apply  log[lastApplied] to state machine
  - If RPC request or response contains term T > currentTerm: set currentTerm = T, convert to follower
###### Followers:
• Respond to RPCs from candidates and leaders
• If election timeout elapses without receiving AppendEntries
RPC from current leader or granting vote to candidate:
convert to candidate
###### Candidates:
• On conversion to candidate, start election:
• Increment currentTerm
• Vote for self
• Reset election timer
• Send RequestVote RPCs to all other servers
• If votes received from majority of servers: become leader
• If AppendEntries RPC received from new leader: convert to
follower
• If election timeout elapses: start new election
###### Leaders:
• Upon election: send initial empty AppendEntries RPCs
(heartbeat) to each server; repeat during idle periods to
prevent election timeouts
• If command received from client: append entry to local log,
respond after entry applied to state machine
• If last log index ≥ nextIndex for a follower: send
AppendEntries RPC with log entries starting at nextIndex
• If successful: update nextIndex and matchIndex for
follower
• If AppendEntries fails because of log inconsistency:
decrement nextIndex and retry
• If there exists an N such that N > commitIndex, a majority
of matchIndex[i] ≥ N, and log[N].term == currentTerm:
set commitIndex = N .


###### summary

- `Election Safety`: at most one leader can be elected in a
given term.
- `Leader Append-Only`: a leader never overwrites or deletes
entries in its log; it only appends new entries. §5.3
- `Log Matching`: if two logs contain an entry with the same
index and term, then the logs are identical in all entries
up through the given index. §5.3
- `Leader Completeness`: if a log entry is committed in a
given term, then that entry will be present in the logs
of the leaders for all higher-numbered terms. §5.4
- `State Machine Safety`: if a server has applied a log entry
at a given index to its state machine, no other server
will ever apply a different log entry for the same index.
